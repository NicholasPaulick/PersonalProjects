# Markov Chain Sentence Generator

This project includes two versions of a Markov Chain Sentence Generator: a basic version and an enhanced version utilizing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for more sophisticated text processing. The generator builds a Markov chain from input text and generates new sentences based on this model.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NLTK (for the enhanced version)

### Installing

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NicholasPaulick/PersonalProjects.git
```

#### Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Easy/Markov-Chain-Sentence
```

### Basic version

No additional installation is required for the basic version

### Enhanced Version with NLTK

Install NLTK:
```bash
pip install nltk
```

## Usage

### Basic Version

The basic version reads input from the provided text file directly as a string in the code.

1. Run the script:
```bash
python MarkovChain.py
```

### Enhanced Version with NLTK

The enhanced version reads text from a file and processes it using NLTK for more accurate tokenization and text cleaning.

1. Run the script:
```bash
python MarkovChainNLTK.py
```
2. When "Enter a starting word:" appears enter a word and click enter
